# Known Bugs #
  * We did not have time to test and make sure that bullets who are tracking a target who is destroyed get destroyed themselves.
  * The enemy is not deleted when it reaches the end of the path.
  * The program randomly freezes once an enemy has been killed.

# How to Play #
The point of the game is to destroy enemies before the reach the end of their path. The destruction can be done by strategically placing towers that shoot enemies. Each bullet decrements the health of the enemy until it is destroyed.

To play, start the game window. In the game window, click load level to load up the first (and so far only) level. At this point, you can begin placing towers to kill the enemies. Click the "Add Tower" button to enable adding a tower. Once you have clicked the button in, mouse over the game window to see indications of where you can place towers. Click on a square slot to add a tower there. Note that when you add a tower you will decrease your score and when you kill an enemy, you will increase your score.

After placing your towers, click on Start Level to have the enemy make their way along the path. When an enemy is in range of a tower, it will shoot at it.

At this point in the development, nothing happens when you win, which is kind of sad, but we have to give you something to look forward to in Milestone 2.
