Awesum Towwa (pronounced similarly to ‘Awesome Tower’) is a tower defense game. The objective of the game is to prevent as many enemies as possible from crossing an endpoint predetermined on the map.

Gameplay consists of enemies traveling down a predetermined path to a certain endpoint, which the player must prevent enemies from reaching. The player builds towers in certain areas that will kill the enemies as they near the tower while crossing the map. The player earns points and cash for each kill his towers makes. The game ends when too many enemies reach the endpoint.

The points the player earns from each kill add up to his high score. The high score will be kept on a leaderboard for the player to compare to his friends. The cash the player earns can be used to create new towers, upgrade preexisting towers or sell upgrades and towers for more money. A variety of towers of different attributes can also be purchased and upgraded by the player.

The game is divided up by levels (or waves). As the level increases, the amount of enemies that appear increase as well. There is a break time between levels where the player can make necessary purchases. Saving is done automatically by level. For instance, at the start of level 2, the auto-save is invoked. If the player exits mid-game and returns, he will start at the beginning of level 2.

Enemies will come in different numbers and in different forms depending on the difficulty. On Easy, the enemies will consist of basic walking units and “Sergeant” units that move slower but have more hit points. On Normal, the enemies will consist of basic walking units, Sergeant units that can attack the towers, and “YOLO” units that move faster but have less hit points. Enemies will be generated at a slightly faster rate and with more units per wave. On Hard, all of the units can attack the towers and a significantly larger amount of units are generated per wave and at a faster rate. At higher difficulties, the player can spend cash on repairs for towers.

The game will also have a map editor feature available. The user would have the option of designing his own maps. The player would be able to determine enemy paths, tower placements, and beginning and endpoint placement.
